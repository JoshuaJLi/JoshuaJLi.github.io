- Worked in team of 8 to create a multiplayer game platform in C++ that interprets game logic from a custom language.
- Applied SOLID design principles to construct a decoupled software architecture that adapted to changing requirements. 
- Used design patterns to decouple game logic traversal from its execution, speeding up development as work could to be done on each component separately. 

- Wrote unit tests in GoogleTest to validate completed work and ensure a robust codebase.
- that runs multiple games seemingly simultaneously on a single thread.
