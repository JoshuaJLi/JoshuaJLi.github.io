For the summer of 2024 I had the opportunity to work with three developers on the webapp for Hope Health Action (HHA). 

The HHA webapp was originally a class term project that was then spun out into an ongoing semester-long project that has been continually developed by a new team of student devs each semester. We worked with the charity [Hope Health Action](https://www.hopehealthaction.org/) to create a webapp that aids in digitizing records of their field hospitals in Haiti.
