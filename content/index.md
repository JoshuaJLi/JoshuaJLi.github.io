# Hello!
My name is Joshua Li and I'm a 3rd year Software Systems student at Simon Fraser University. I'm using this website as a home for all of my cool technical projects both in and outside of school. 

It can be a lot to look at! That's why I've sorted them by [[Technical Experience#Languages| languages]] and [[Technical Experience#Frameworks| frameworks]]. You can also just scroll down to the [[index#Highlights | highlights]] to quickly see some of the projects I'm most proud of.
